# About Me

Hi! I'm Kyle O'Dore, a Vietnamese-American software engineer passionate about technology and problem-solving. I'm currently a **Software Development Engineer** at **SAP SuccessFactors** in San Francisco, CA, where I work on enterprise human capital management solutions that serve millions of users worldwide.

## Background & Heritage

Born in Hà Nội, Vietnam to an American father and Vietnamese mother, I've had the unique experience of growing up across multiple cultures and continents. From Bangkok, Thailand, to Wrentham, Massachusetts, to Hà Nội and Hồ Chí Minh City (Sài Gòn), Vietnam - this diverse international background has profoundly shaped my perspective on technology, collaboration, and problem-solving.

## Education & Academic Journey

I'm a graduate of the **University of Washington Bothell Campus** with a B.S. in Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE). My academic journey was quite interesting - I originally started at the Seattle campus as an Applied Physics major with a focus on Electronics and Quantum Mechanics. As a kid, I was always tinkering with things, taking apart paperclips and broken toys to understand how they worked. While I was naturally drawn to both physics and computers, late in my junior year I transferred to the Bothell campus to pursue Computer Science because software engineering aligned more closely with the types of problems I wanted to solve.
