# Building an Intelligent Resume Automation System

## Project Overview

I recently developed a comprehensive **AI-powered resume automation system** that automatically tailors resumes to specific job postings using advanced artificial intelligence and modern microservices architecture. This project represents the intersection of AI/ML technologies with enterprise-grade software engineering practices.

## The Problem

Job seekers often struggle with tailoring their resumes to specific job postings, a time-consuming process that involves:
- Analyzing job requirements and company culture
- Rewriting experience descriptions to highlight relevant skills
- Optimizing content for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Ensuring consistent professional formatting

## The Solution

I architected and implemented a microservices-based system that automates this entire process using:

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Job Analysis**
- **OpenAI GPT-4 integration** for intelligent job posting analysis
- **spaCy NLP processing** for requirement extraction and skill identification
- **Company culture analysis** to understand tone and work environment
- **Skill importance scoring** based on job posting context

### 🏗️ **Enterprise Architecture**
- **Microservices design** with independent, scalable services
- **API Gateway** with JWT authentication and rate limiting
- **PostgreSQL database** with async SQLAlchemy operations
- **Redis caching** for performance optimization
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment

### 📄 **Professional Output**
- **LaTeX PDF generation** with dynamic templates
- **ATS optimization** for compatibility with recruitment systems
- **One-page format enforcement** with intelligent content prioritization
- **Professional formatting** with multiple template options

## Technical Implementation
