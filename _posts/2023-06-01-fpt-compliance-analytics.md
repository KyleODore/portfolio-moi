- **Software Development**: Contributed to both frontend and backend development
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensured the application met enterprise-grade reliability and security standards
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive technical documentation for future maintenance

## Technical Challenges

The project involved several significant technical challenges:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring all features met strict industry standards
- **Data Security**: Implementing robust security measures for sensitive compliance data
- **Scalability**: Designing systems to handle enterprise-level data volumes
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive interfaces for complex compliance workflows

## Skills Developed

This internship provided invaluable experience in:

- Enterprise software development
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Team collaboration in corporate environments
- Agile development methodologies

## Impact

The application successfully streamlined compliance processes, reducing manual workload and improving accuracy in regulatory reporting. This project demonstrated the importance of bridging technical implementation with business requirements in enterprise environments.

Working at FPT-USA gave me insight into the software development lifecycle in a corporate setting and the importance of building robust, scalable solutions for real-world business challenges.
